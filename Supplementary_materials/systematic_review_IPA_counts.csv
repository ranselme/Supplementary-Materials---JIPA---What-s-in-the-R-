There is considerable phonetic variation in LE according to age_ gender and socioeconomic class_ although this is an area where modern research is lacking.,Post-vocalic /r/ is absent in LE_ so that words like car_ farm_ park are r-less. In pre- vocalic and intervocalic positions_ /r/ is typically realised as [ɹ] or [ɾ]. The tap is common in intervocalic position (e.g. mi[ɾ]or_ ve[ɾ]y) but can also occur when /r/ follows an onset obstruent (e.g. st[ɾ]ip_ b[ɾ]eath_ f[ɾ]ee). The speaker’s variety is somewhat atypical of basilectal Liverpool English in this respect_ as she uses the standard variant [ɹ] in all positions (e.g. ag[ɹ]eed_ a[ɹ]ound_ st[ɹ]onger). The tapped realisation of /r/ is not categorically absent from her repertoire_ however_ as she uses [ɾ] as the linking /r/ in stronger[ɹ] of the two.

The speaker who has read the words for this Illustration displayed significant variability in the pronunciation of the lateral flap. Sometimes it is realized as an alveolar tap as in [ɛiciBiɾiːti] ‘matchbox’_ [ɛ̂ IBɛ̀ːɾɛ̀] ‘breast’ and [ɛ̌ːziɾɔ̀] ‘soot’. In other instances_ it appears as an alveolar lateral approximant: [ɛ̂Idwâːlilɔ̀] ‘hospital’_ [ɔ̀kùlɔ̀Bà] ‘to refuse’. Alveolar lateral flaps are rare in languages of the world: UPSID lists nine languages (2%) with this sound. One of the better-known examples is Japanese (Okada 1991). In Lusoga_ the alveolar lateral flap occurs contrastively with a labialized flap: [ɔ̀kùɺwà] ‘to be late’ vs. [ɔ́kùɺà] ‘you grow up’_ [ɛ̀ciɡɛ̂ːnɛ̀ɺɛ̀ɺwà] ‘aim_ goal’ vs. [ɛ̀ciɡɛ̂ːndɛ̀ɺɛ̀ɺà] ‘is intended’.

Older speakers pronounce [ʀ] or [ʁ] also word-finally (Bir [biːʀ] ‘pear’) whereas younger speakers often show r-vocalization and produce central [ə] or [ɐ] instead ([biːə] for Bir). Between short vowels and consonants /r/ is spirantized_ either to a voiced [ʁ] as in Parmesan [ˈpɑʁməzaːn] ‘Parmesan cheese’ or to an unvoiced [X] as in parken [ˈpɑXkən] ‘to park’. Thus_ whether /r/ shows up here as voiced or unvoiced fricative depends on the voicing feature of the following consonant.,Among the fricatives_ [X] and [ɕ] are allophones of one single phoneme /X/. The same holds for their voiced counterparts [ʁ] and [ʑ] with the latter allophone appearing only in a few words_ however. The selection of the allophone is determined_ as in German_ by the preceding context ([X ʁ] after phonologically back vowels_ [ɕ ʑ] elsewhere). An increasing number of speakers no longer distinguish between the alveolo-palatal and the post-alveolar fricatives_ i.e. between [ʃ] and [ɕ] on the one hand and between [ʒ] and [ʑ] on the other. The progression of the sound change may eventually lead to a phoneme merger thus reducing the number of the fricatives.

Punnoose et al. (2013) distinguish the liquids by place_ manner_ as well as quality: /ɾ l ɻ/ are ‘clear_’ having a palatalized quality with a raised second formant in adjacent vowels_ whereas /r ɭ/ are ‘dark’ and lack palatalization. For example_ Asher & Kumari (1997: 418) report that the tap /ɾ/ has a ‘distinct palatal resonance’; similarly_ Jiang (2010) labels the sound as /ɾj/. Though auditorily weak for our speaker_ the palatalized quality in /ɾ/ can be seen in Figure 4_ which shows /maɾam/ ‘tree’ versus /mara/ ‘covering’. The second formant in /a/ spectrograms of rises above 2000 Hz adjacent to /ɾ/_ but not adjacent to /r/. \\ Aside from its palatalized quality_ there is some debate as to the manner of articulation of /ɾ/. Ladefoged & Maddieson (1996: 222_ after Ladefoged_ Cochran & Disner 1997) say that some speakers produce /ɾ/ as a trill that is slightly more advanced than /r/. However_ our speaker consistently produces /ɾ/ as a tap. In contrast_ /r/ is often very short and accompanied by frication_ phonetically [ɾ̝] or [r̝] ,The place and manner of the retroflex central approximant /ɻ/ has been subject to much debate. Kumari (1972: 27–28) calls it a ‘voiced retroflex palatal fricativised lateral’_ whereas Asher & Kumari (1997: 419) call it a ‘voiced sublamino-palatal approximant’. Because it has been reported to have frication (Kumari 1972)_ the sound is traditionally symbolized as /ʐ/ (Asher & Kumari 1997_ Punnoose et al. 2013)_ but in our data this sound is always an approximant. Indeed_ in an ultrasound study_ Scobbie et al. (2013) found that /ɻ/ is a retroflex approximant with an advanced tongue root and raised tongue body_ as well as a lateral release. Punnoose et al. (2013) transcribe the sound narrowly as advanced and palatalized [”± j ]. This phonetic transcription accords well with the recordings in our illustration: /ɻ/ has a palatalized quality (a raising of the second formant) similar to that found for the /ɾ/ (see Figure 4). \\ The labiodental approximant /ʋ/ may be realized as [ʋ]_ [v]_ [w]_ or [B̞ ] (Asher & Kumari 1997).

This variation was first noted for speakers of Mennonite Plautdietsch in Mexico by Moelleken (1966_ 1993)_ who argues on the basis of comparative research on contemporary non-Mennonite varieties of Plautdietsch that the retroflex approximant is not a recent innovation prompted by contact with English. Given the historical relationship between the Mennonite Plautdietsch speech communities in Mexico and their source communities in Canada_ it is not surprising to find such variation attested in the Canadian Old Colony Mennonite Plautdietsch represented in the speech of the speaker described here (e.g. Däaren [de.əɹn] ‘doors’_ foahren [fo.əɹn] ‘to drive’_ Korn /kɔɹn/ ‘corn_ maize’). ,The [ɹ] allophone is reportedly a sociolinguistically-marked variant associated with this particular variety and is subject to commentary by other Mennonite Plautdietsch speakers in Saskatchewan (Jake Buhler_ p.c.). \\ THE TAP SHOULD BE THE SYMBOL USED !

This substitution of [s] by [ɾ] occurs before nasals as well. In general_ the replacement of /s/ by [ɾ] is disapproved of by the local population_ who judge it to be typical of a very marked local accent. \\ Although frowned upon by speakers using a more refined variety_ the replacement of /l/ by /ɾ/ in coda position is another distinguishing characteristic of Murcian speech_ also found in other Southern Spanish accents (Andalusian_ Canario and Extremeño according to Garc ıa-Mouton 1994: 35). As a result_ pronunciations like [ˈaɾɣo] for [ˈalɣo] algo ‘something’ and [ˈaɾto] for [ˈalto] alto ‘high/tall’ are very commonly heard_ yielding instances of homophony (e.g. alto/harto [ˈaɾto] ‘tall’/‘fed up’_ caldo/cardo [ˈkaɾðo] ‘soup’/‘thistle’_ falda/farda [ˈfaɾða] ‘skirt’/‘(s)he boasts’).,Linked to this is the specific behaviour of syllable coda /ɾ/ followed by syllable onset /l/ acting as codas and heads of a syllable. One of the most noticeable characteristics of Murcian is the full assimilation of /ɾ/ to /l/_ so that words like Carlos ‘Charles’_ peinarla ‘to comb her’_ decir le ‘to tell him/her’_ por la calle ‘along the street’_ etc. are pronounced with double [l]_ e.g. [ˈkæl-lɔ]_ [peiˈnal-la]_ [dɛˈθil-le]_ [pɔl-la ˈkaʝe]_ respectively. Gemination can then be a regular feature of MuSp. The opposite phenomenon – the replacement of /l/ by /ɾ/ – is also common in colloquial Murcian_ e.g. está en el rı́o [ . . . ɛɾ-ˈr ıo] ‘in the river_ alrededor [æɾ-rɛð̞ ɛˈð̞ ɔ ] ‘around’_ el ramo [ . . . ɛɾ-ˈramo] ‘the branch’. This may happen not only in cases where /ɾ/ follows: /l/ may become /ɾ/ in front of any single consonant with the exception of /ɾ/ itself_ so it is not uncommon to hear expressions like [ɛɾ ˈsɔ] el sol ‘the sun’_ [ɛɾ ˈθumo] el zumo ‘the juice’_ [ɛɾ ˈkæmpo] el campo ‘the country’_ [ɛɾ ˈβ̞ jen̪ to] el viento ‘the wind’_ [ɛɾ ˈʧiko] el chico ‘the boy’_ etc.

In our data_ it is realized as a short (two- or three-tap) trill [r] or sometimes as a single tap [ɾ] at the beginning of the word_ but as a single tap or flap when intervocalic or at the end of the word. These differences may reflect inter-speaker variation. We take the word-initial trill variant [r] as the basic variant of this phoneme_ consistent with our practice elsewhere_ but it should be kept in mind that the Nepali trills are weaker than Spanish or Italian trills.

An example of the trilled articulation in the word /nɔ̀χà / ‘snake’ is illustrated in Figure 1. Four periodic lines (which do not match the period of glottal pulses) are clearly distinguishable in the spectrogram during the word-medial /χ/_ marked with dashed lines. These correspond to three distinct peaks in the waveform_ indicating three separate contacts with the uvula – i.e. a trilled articulation. Most previous descriptions (generally based on other varieties of Setswana) describe the phoneme /χ/ as a velar fricative /x/ rather than uvular (Doke 1954_ Cole 1955_ IPA 2010_ Gouskova_ Zsiga & Tlale Boyer 2011). It is cognate with aspirated velar stops in related languages (compare /áχà / ‘build’ with Xhosa /akʰa/). While occasional tokens of /χ/ do sound close to velar [x]_ the normal realization sounds distinctly post-velar in our data. In post-nasal context_ /χ/ hardens to the uvular affricate /qχ/ (e.g. [χá] ‘fetch water’ > [ŋ̀ qʀ̥ ɔ] ‘water pot’).,The trill /r/ normally has 2–3 taps (see section on doubled consonants below for further discussion).  While the singleton trill [r] normally involves 2–3 contacts_ the doubled trills involve 6–8 contacts (rather than 4–6).

For instance_ the imperative marker /(k)ɘɁr/_ as occurring in /ˈpaɁ.kɘɁr/ ‘Go!’_ /tu.ˈpi.tɘɁr / ‘Follow him!’_ /ˈu.kɘɁr / ‘Drink!’_ frequently appears as /(k)ɘr/. In word-final position_ the contrast can usually only be ascertained after suffixation. A word-internal contrast is illustrated by /ˈmɘr.pi/ ‘belly’ versus /ˈmɘɁr.pi/ ‘ripe’_ while /wɘ.ˈran/ ‘having stung.3 SG ’ versus /wɘɁr.ˈan/ ‘having got lost.3SG ’_ both containing the 3 SG participle suffix /an/_ and /ˈkɘr.ʎi/ ‘he brought’ versus /ˈkɘɁr.ʎi/ ‘it is black’_ both containing the 3 SG suffix /ʎi(n)/_ illustrate a morpheme-final contrast before a vowel and a consonant_ respectively. Glottalized /Ɂr/ is a tap accompanied by a glottal closure. ,Preceding a word-internal consonant or_ when it is present_ word-finally_ the glottal closure is initiated during the tap_ creating creaky voice and often reaching full closure terminating the consonant. Intervocalic /Ɂr/ is post-glottalized as [r.ʔ]_ as in /wɘɁr.ˈan/ [wɘr.ˈʔan] ‘having got lost.3 SG ’_ /kwɘɁr.ˈa.pa.lɘk/ [kwɘr.ˈʔa.pa.lɘk] ‘I am (currently) heavy’_ /kwɘ Ɂ r/ ‘heavy’ + /iɁn/ ‘not’ + /ʎi/ ‘3 SG ’ [kwɘr.ˈɁiɁ.ɲiɁ] ‘it’s not heavy’. (On /ɲi/ as the pronunciation of /ʎi/ see section ‘Other processes’.) This is parallel to word-final /k/_ as in [u.ˈkɘk.Ɂa.pa.ʎi] ‘the blood on him stinks’_ mentioned under Plosives above. Before consonants_ particularly /ʎ/_ /Ɂr/ may be realized as [d] or [t]_ as in [nuˈkɘdʎi] /nu.ˈkɘ Ɂ r.ʎi/ ‘I’m cold’. This also applies to /ˈkɘɁr.ʎi/ ‘it is black’_ mentioned above. The unglottalized /r/ is an alveolar tap in the onset and an alveolar trill in the coda. \\ No trill

Opinion is divided over whether this corresponds to a phonetic distinction in colloquial Tamil: Balasubramanian (1982a) argues that always corresponds phonetically to a tap_ whilst [ɾ] and [r] are both possible realizations of _ their distribution being determined in part by environment. Narayanan_ Byrd and Kaun (1999) report a slight difference in place_ rather than manner_ of articulation_ with pre-alveolar and post- alveolar. In most colloquial varieties_ however_ it seems that a merger is in progress_ if not complete.,A further liquid_ orthographically _ exists in many varieties of Tamil although production of the distinctive sound is sometimes restricted to formal speech. One possible substitute is [ɭ]_ to which it is acoustically very similar. Claims about its articulatory properties have been many and various_ but two extensive recent studies_ employing a range of experimental methods_ have concluded that it is best described as a central retroflex approximant [ɻ] (McDonough & Johnson 1997 and Narayanan et al. 1999). The anterior tongue body is said to be curved up towards the central palatal region_ with lateral contact between the sides of the mid-tongue and the palate.

This phenomenon occurs in the intervocalic position both within single words and across word boundaries. For example_ the word ud ‘worm’ becomes [ˈurun] ‘to become infested with worms’. The word dayaw ‘goodness’ becomes [maˈrayaw] ‘to have the quality of goodness’. The phrase duwa di duwa duun ‘two here two there’ becomes [ˈduwa ri ˈruwa ˈruʔun].,When [r] occurs as a phoneme_ not as an allophone of /d/_ it is manifested as a flap. There is also some free variation between the [r] and the alveolar lateral approximant [l] (e.g. parman [ˈparman]  [ˈpalman] ‘word’_ sarta [ˈsar taʔ] ~ [ˈsal taʔ] ‘simultaneously’_  ~sarsila [sarˈsila]  [salˈsila] ‘genealogy’).

In the present set of recordings_ in addition to a simple tap_ a trilled variant [r] was observed word-initially (e.g. /ˈɾuna/ [ˈɾuna]_ compare [ˈruna] ‘person’). Note that both cases are realized with a prothetic vowel; see Figure 13. The presence of a rhotic trill may be due in part to influence from the multiple trilled variant in Spanish_ especially in more careful speech styles_ such as in reading. In addition_ the rhotic may be naturally strengthened to a trill at the onset of a stressed syllable. There appears to be a degree of variation in this aspect since both the simple tap and trill are found after a pause_ such that the trill is not obligatory in this context. Also_ a retroflex approximant [ɹ] was found (e.g. [tʃuɹa-ˈɾi-ʃka] ‘put- REFL - PAST . PART ’; Figure 14).

Use of [ʋ] appears to be on the increase among young Tyneside women_ but is only very rarely used by older or male TE speakers.

TE is a non-rhotic accent of English_ meaning that [ɹ] is not realised in post-vocalic positions (e.g. cart_ doctor) unless it is followed by a vowel_ as in very_ Murray_ colour is_ etc. So-called ‘intrusive’ [ɹ]_ as in comma in_ is used by the informant where a word-boundary intervenes_ but is generally absent in more traditional TE_ in which [ʔ] is frequently inserted in these contexts (see Foulkes 1998).

Where /ʀ/ and /ʀʲ/ are realized as a trill_ they both typically have 1–2 contacts between the tongue and the uvula. However_ both are often produced as an approximant [ʁ] (e.g. rat [ʁat] ‘good’) and [ʀʲ] (e.g. rjadka [ʁ j atka] ‘line_ verse’). /ʀ/ is also frequently realized as either a voiced or a voiceless uvular fricative_ [ʁ] (e.g. rat [ʁat] ‘gladly’) and [χ] (e.g. rat [χat] ‘gladly’)_ respectively. Jocz (2013) notes that /ʀ/ and /ʀʲ/ are more likely to be realized as a trill in clear and careful pronunciation. The rhotic is also occasionally dropped from speech completely_ leaving only the glide (e.g. rjadka [jatka] ‘line_ verse’). The phonemic status of /ʀʲ/_ however_ is somewhat contentious among Sorbian linguists; it has been described as a phonemically palatalized uvular trill by some researchers (Šewc 1984)_ while others have stated that it has undergone depalatalization and is now biphonemic_ /ʀj/ (Wornar 2007_ Jocz 2013),The phoneme /x/ is often realized as a voiceless trill with noticeable frication_ which typically has 2–3 contacts between the tongue and the uvula (e.g. brach [bʁaʀ̝̊ ] ‘fault_ defect’).

This variation may be due to the fact that_ by contrast to Spanish_ voiceless velar friction was absent in Asturian and there was no opposition with other approximant or fricative sounds articulated in the velar or post-velar area. Given the ample margin for pronunciation without confusion with other sounds and an imprecise pronunciation characteristic of the velar_ voiced_ or even voiceless sounds_ uvular fricative pronunciations are frequently encountered (Muñiz-Cachón 2002).,A recent addition to Asturian is a voiceless dorsal fricative_ the place of articulation of which is between that of the velar [x] and the uvular [χ]; here it is transcribed as velar [x]. Though it is currently used in very few words_ it is becoming increasingly more common due to the influence of Castilian Spanish (Garcı́a-Arias 2003: 29).

Note_ however_ that Chinese linguistic tradition represents these sounds with the symbols [ɿ] for the fricative vowel which follows alveolar consonants_ and [ʅ] for the fricative vowel which follows retroflex consonants (Handel 2016). The fricative vowels are represented in the orthography – the [z̩ ] is written with ‘I’ and the [ʐ̩ ] is written with inverted ‘U’. Thus_ as already mentioned above_ the orthography is suggesting that [z̩ ] ~ [ɿ] is an allophone of /i/ and [ʐ̩ ] ~ [ʅ] is an allophone of /y/; however_ some dialects have alveolar affricates /ts ts h dz/ and fricatives /s z/ before [i] /i/_ contrasting with [z̩ ] /-i/ after these same initials.,[f] which can be treated as an allophone of the glottal stop before /u/. There are also two phonemic voiced fricatives: retroflex /ʐ/ and velar /ɣ/. However_ retroflex /ʐ/ is often produced without friction_ rendering it much more similar to the rhotic [ɻ]_ as can be heard in the example word /ʐo 21 / ‘we (inclusive)’ – the first two repetitions here have some friction_ whereas the last repetition does not (on another recording we have of the speaker saying the same word_ the first repetition has friction_ and the second and third don’t). We class the sound as a fricative phonologically in Lisu because languages in the Ngwi sub-group of Tibeto-Burman (to which Lisu belongs) do not have a rhotic phoneme

These variants may be devoiced in word-initial and word-final contexts. The trill is articulated as a tap [ɾ] intervocalically (e.g. /sa'rap/ [sa'ɾap] ‘five’) and in consonant clusters when flanked by consonants (e.g. /xprʃa/ [xpɾʃa] ‘sycamore’). Word-initially_ this sound can be produced as a partially devoiced trill [r̥ ] (e.g. /rap/ [r̥ ap] ‘pain’_ /'rʔaːk/ [r̥ ʔ aːk̙ ] ‘elderly men’). The trill can also be realized with varying degrees of frication_ voicing_ and retroflexion in word-medial rime contexts (e.g. /ku'rʔak/ [k̙ ur̞ ' ̥ ʔak̙ ] ‘elderly man’ and /ka'sark/ ‘left’ [ka'saʃk]) but varies freely with a tap articulation (e.g. /t͡ ʃ ir'kwi loi/ [t͡ ʃ Iɾ'kwi loi] ‘ant that lives in oak trees’ and /per'wi/ [pəɾ'wi] ‘dove’). Word-finally_ this sound is generally devoiced (e.g. /aɬ j 'mar/ [aɬ j 'mar] ‘to light a fire’_ /tiɲor/ [t ̪ i ɲor̞̥ ] ‘to color’).

The fricative trill in Mbarrumbathama is cognate with voiceless trills in other Lamalamic languages (see Verstraete 2017 on Umbuygamu and Godman 1993 on Rimanggudinhma)_ and has also been analysed as a voiceless trill in previous analyses of Mbarrumbathama (see Rigsby 1997_ Sommer 1999). As I argue in more detail below_ however_ at least in the speech of Daisy Salt (the point of reference for this study)_ this item belongs in the class of fricatives because it has both voiced and voiceless allophones_ and behaves like a fricative rather than a trill in terms of the distribution of voicing. \\ Finally_ the consonant inventory in Mbarrumbathama also has a trill_ a lateral_ and two approximants. 6 Within this set_ one specific allophonic process concerns the trill_ which can be voiceless in utterance-final contexts,Mbarrumbathama also has a fricative trill_ as in /ˈr̝ a ɹ/ rhar ‘sore’ (DS). From a comparative perspective_ this is the equivalent of what is a voiceless trill in other Lamalamic languages (e.g. Umbuygamu_ see Verstraete 2017)_ and it has also been analysed as a voiceless trill for Mbarrumbathama (see Rigsby 1997_ possibly also Sommer 1998). Phonetically_ this element has both features of a trill and features of a fricative_ as illustrated in Figures 10–12 below. All examples show at least one period of vibration_ characterized by a closure phase followed by an open phase. In addition_ they show the high-frequency energy typical of fricatives_ in the open phases following closure and in a longer final fricative phase preceding the vowel (not unlike the Czech trill <ř>_ described as a laminal trill by Ladefoged & Maddieson 1996ː 228–230).  In some cases_ this final fricative phase is followed by an approximant phase transitioning into the vowel (e.g. (16c) below_ see Figure 12)_ presumably reflecting further lowering of the tongue after the fricative phase. By itself_ such mixed features could justify either a classification as a trill or as a fricative (see also Solé 2002 on phonetic links between fricatives and voiceless trills). Crucially_ however_ the element is not uniformly voiceless_ which obviously goes against previous analyses as a voiceless trill. In the speech of Daisy Salt_ there is a regular alternation between voiceless and voiced variants_ 5 with the same distribution as other fricatives in Lamalama: predominantly voiceless in utterance-initial position_ as in (16a) below_ and predominantly voiced intervocalically and in clusters_ as in (16b_ c). In this sense_ a classification as a fricative appears to be the most natural solution. I use the symbol /r̝ / to represent this sound; this representation has also been used for Czech <ř>_ which seems to be the closest equivalent  typologically (although Howson_ Komova & Gick 2014 argue that tongue height is not the basic feature distinguishing <ř> in Czech).

The distribution of this pair is defective in the sense that the flap occurs intervocalically_ word-finally_ and in consonant clusters (plosive–flap)_ whereas the trill occurs word-initially and intervocalically (see Harris 1969 for phonological analysis). There is a previously undescribed realization of the trill in the speech of some speakers of Mexico City Spanish. The most salient observation indicates that the trill is also realized as a voiced retroflex fricative [ʐ]_ especially noticeable in the speech of middle-class female speakers. Such pronunciation was also found in the speech of some the speakers included in this illustration. Figure 1 includes the sound pressure oscillograms and corresponding spectrograms illustrating the variation of the phonemic trill in two female speakers (f2 and f3).,

Philippine English has had American rather than British influence from the beginning_ however_ so it is highly rhotic in comparison. According to Tayao (2008: 162)_ the rhotic in the acrolect is quite similar to the approximant /ɹ/ of American English_ although it is often tapped or trilled in the basilect or mesolect due to L1 influence. In fact_ the approximant seems to be spreading across sociolects and even influencing other Philippine languages; for example_ its use seems to be widespread in the different varieties of English or Taglish (Tagalog–English codeswitching) used on television_ and Lesho (2013) has found that it has become common in Cavite Chabacano (a Tagalog–Spanish creole)_ especially in coda position and among female speakers.,In this Philippine English sample_ all speakers used an approximant /ɹ/ across different phonological environments. In the word list_ [ɹ] occurred in simple or complex onsets (rock_ arrive_ pray) and post-vocalically before a consonant or pause (portion_ fare). In addition_ [ɝ] appeared in words belonging to the NURSE set (word) and in unstressed final syllables (dipper). There were no instances of /ɹ/ being trilled or tapped in any of the tasks_ with three near exceptions. In one token of strengths (Speaker 2) and two of threw (Speaker 4)_ an epenthetic vowel was inserted before the rhotic_ which was then partially tapped. \\ The speakers were also consistently rhotic during the reading passage. They produced [ɹ] or [ɝ] in every possible post-vocalic context before a consonant or pause (e.g. hard [ˈhɑɹd]_ stronger [ˈstɹɔŋɡɝ]).

Further research is needed to understand the lexical-specific swap. Furthermore_ /ɥ/ was reported to be produced as [j] in the old variety (Han 1993b). \\ Tianjin Mandarin has two syllabic consonants (notation in line with Chao 1948): the dentoalveolar /ɹ̪̩/_ as in /ts̪ɹ̪̩3 ̩ / ‘son’_ and postalveolar /ɹ̺̩/_ as in /tʃɹ̺̩3 ̩ / ‘paper’. These two phonemes are traditionally referred to as ‘apical vowels’ by Sinologists. Ladefoged & Maddieson (1996) refer to them as ‘fricative vowels’. With evidence from both ultrasound imaging and acoustic data_ Lee-Kim (2014) shows that these two phonemes are neither vowels nor fricative_ but more comparable with approximants in nature_ i.e. syllabic dental approximant /ɹ̪ / and retroflex approximant /ɻ/_ respectively. This is similar to observations made in Lee & Zee (2003_ 2014)_ in which_ however_ the two sounds have been transcribed with the same syllabic approximant /ɹ̩ /. The dentoalveolar /ɹ̪̩/ only follows dentoalveolar consonants /ts̪ ts̪ h s̪ / (as in /ts̪ɹ̪̩3 / ‘son’_ /ts̪ hɹ̪̩2 / ‘word’_ /s̪ ɹ̪̩1 / ‘to think’)_ while /ɹ̺̩/ follows postalveolar consonants /tʃ ̺ tʃ h ̺ ʃ ̺ / (as in /tʃɹ̺̩3 / ‘paper’_ /tʃ hɹ̺̩ 1 / ‘to eat’_ /ʃ ɹ̺̩ 1 / ‘poem’). Their tongue configurations are similar to the preceding homorganic consonants_ i.e. /ɹ̺ / ̩ is homorganic with /ts̪ _ ts̪ h _ s̪ /_ and /ɹ̺/ ̩ is homorganic with /tʃ ̺ tʃ h ̺ ʃ ̺ /. In addition_ /ɹ̺̩/ can occur by itself as in /ɹ̺4 ̩ / ‘the sun’. To highlight the homorganicity of the preceding consonants and the following syllabic approximants_ we transcribe the two syllabic consonants with two independent symbols as in Lee-Kim (2014)_ but we adopted the postalveolar /ɹ̺/ ̩ symbol rather than the retroflex /ɻ̩ /.

In case of /r̞/_ the place of articulation is normally similar to that for /r/. Although it may be produced with the blade of the tongue_ the main differentiating characteristic from /r/ is the number of vibrations_ which may be 1-2 greater than in /r/_ and their lesser amplitude than for the vibrations in /r/. Also_ the constriction is narrower and the velocity of air greater. This sound often starts as a trill but continues as a fricative and thus probably the best term for it is 'alveolar trill fricative' with the symbol /r̞/. (The laminal diacritic /r̥/ used in Ladefoged & Maddieson (1996) does not capture the sound's defining property). A voiceless allophone of /r̞/ occurs in places where voicing assimilation applies.,

O,Hausa,haus1257,1993,voiced tap/trill alveolar (r) & voiced tap/trill alveolar (retroflex flap : ɽ),r,Narrow transcription & Orthographic version,phonetic,,, r & ɽ,36,NA,0,NA,36,,1,normal usage of r,"Tap/trill: Most Hausa speakers distinguish two tap sounds in the alveolar region_ [r_ ɽ]. The first is the ""canonical trilled r"" sound_ found in many of the world's languages. It can be realized minimally as a single tap_ but often has multiple taps_ especially word initially or finally_ and obligatorily when geminated for morphological purposes. The [ɽ] is a retroflex flap_ realized by flipping the tongue forward across the alveolar ridge. Newman (1980) provides the most extensive discussion of the status_ distribution_ and history of these sounds in Hausa. Ladefoged (1968:30) was the first to investigate the sounds instrumentally_ and though he notes the distinct articulations_ he states_ ""Indeed I have not been able to find any consistent acoustic difference between the two sounds."" The two are clearly contrastive as shown by the oft-cited though far from unique minimal pair_ [bɘra:] 'begging' vs. [bɘɽa:] 'servant' (both orthographic bara)_ but in the one tap mode illustrated by a pair such as this_ they are often difficult to distinguish. However_ when they are lengthened through one of several morphological processes_ the long variants share little articulatory or acoustic similarity. In pairs such as [ja:rɘrrɘbke:ʃi] 'he flogged him' vs. [ʃa:ɽɘɽɽe:] 'swept' (orthographic ya rarrabke shi and shararre respectively)_ the long [rr] is an alveolar trill whereas the long [ɽɽ] is a prolonged retroflex approximant (see Ladefoged and Maddieson (forthcoming) for instrumental data and discussion). It should be noted that in the sample text below_ the distinction between the two r's is not indicated. The speaker for this text is among the minority of Hausa speakers who have only the single r sound_ [r].",

See Gussenhoven and Broeders (1976 :132). In intervocalic position_ e.g. nieuwe ' new' (inflected form) the labio-dental approximant jvf is in free variation with /u/: /niʋə/ or /niuə/. /ʋ/ has a similar place of articulation to /f_ f̬/. In syllable-initial context_ there is an approximation between the upper front teeth and the inner part of the lower lip; the lip moves back with a brushing effect. The articulation is markedly ENDOLABIAL_ as opposed to the EXOLABIAL labio-dental approximant to be heard in_ amongst other languages_ Hindi_ or as a type of ' defective ' /r/ in some English (see Gimson 1980:208). In connected speech there is usually voiced friction; consequently_ it would be possible to regard /ʋ/ as a type of voiced labio-dental fricative with approximant allophones. It is distinguished from /f̬/ by its less energetic articulation and weak friction. The typical realization of /ʋ/ often bears a strong resemblance to English /v/ in that it is a weakly voiced labio-dental fricative. In initial clusters preceding /r/_ /ʋ/ is realized as a fricative_ e.g. wraak [vra:k] ' revenge '; wreker ['vreikor] ' avenger '. Many speakers appear to consider <w> in this context to represent /f̬̬/.,In ABN_ realizations of /r/ include both apico-alveolar and dorso-uvular articulations. Individuals generally confine themselves to one or the other—any variation being attributable to socio-linguistic factors. Elocutionists have traditionally encouraged the alveolar articulation (see_ for instance_ Zwaardemaker and Eijkman_ 1928:203) and newsreaders_ actors and public speakers_ who otherwise have uvular /r/ as their natural articulation_ can be heard attempting to replace this by alveolar trills or taps in formal speech. However_ several commentators have stated that uvular /r/ is not only gaining ground over alveolar /r/ but is also associated with socially prestigious accents. Our own informal observations certainly confirm what has already been noted by_ amongst others_ Trudgill (1974 :219-21) and Chambers and Trudgill (1980 :191). Uvular /r/ is common in educated speech_ not only in the region around The Hague (see Elias_ 1977 :23-31) but also in many other parts of the Netherlands. In central and southern areas (Limburg_ Noord-Brabant_ and portions of Gelderland_ Utrecht and Zuid-Holland) it is typical of speakers from all socio-economic backgrounds. It is interesting that uvular /r/ does NOT appear to have found general acceptance in the capital city_ Amsterdam_ being confined there to a relatively small number of speakers of high social status_ and thus running counter to the general principle suggested by Trudgill (1974:221) that ' diffusion has taken the form of the jumping of uvular-r from one large urban centre to another '.

Thus_ our data supports Fischer & Hengeveld’s claim that the sound is indeed the labiodental approximant_ [ʋ]_ which had been erroneously described by Borman (1962: 51) as being the voiced bilabial fricative /β/ with labiodental variants following low unrounded vowels. This misinterpretation was likely due to the fact that aerodynamic constraints can result in voiced fricatives being more sonorous than their voiceless counterparts_ however_ the lack of other voiced fricatives in the phonological inventory are consistent with this sound being an approximant phonologically and not just phonetically.,no tap in the transcription

Although it has been claimed that realization of /r/ is contextual_ with the trill occurring in initial position and the tap occurring elsewhere (O’Neill 2015_ citing Thomas-Fattier 1982)_ speakers in the current dataset produce either allophone in either context. For example_ Betsileo speaker JR4 produces trills initially and medially in the following: rano [ˈ ranu] ‘water’_ atoraka [aˈ túrəka] ‘to be thrown’. Betsileo/Merina speaker HR2 produces an initial trill in ritsa [ˈ ritsḁ] ‘evaporated’ and a devoiced medial trill in tery [ˈ tér̥ɪ] ‘narrow’_ but a medial tap in orana [ˈ uɾana] ‘rain’. As mentioned above_ speakers whose /r/ is prominently trilled sometimes_ though not always_ produce orthographic sequences dr and tr (and ndr and ntr) as stop–trill combinations rather than as affricates.,Whereas the trill variant is common in Betsileo_ many bilingual speakers in Antananarivo use a more retracted_ fricated variant for /r/; as suggested by Rakotofiringa (1982:544–545)_ this is due to influence from French. Rakotofiringa (1982) indicated that these speakers use a voiced uvular trill [ʀ] for this phoneme; I have observed use of the uvular fricatives [χ] and [ʁ]_ mirroring the French sound. For example_ speaker ALJM uses uvular fricatives in the following: rano [' χanʊ] ‘water’_ ritra [ˈ χiʈʂá] ‘evaporated’_ torana [ˈ túʁana] ‘unconscious’.

Traditional descriptions indicate that the velarised rhotic is produced as a velarised trill (Borgstrøm 1940_ Oftedal 1956)_ but most speakers now produce the velarised/alveolar rhorics as taps or approximants_ and trills are very rare in contemporary production (Ó Dochartaigh 1997_ Nance et al. 2016). The palatalised rhotic is often produced as a dental fricative [ð] in Lewis and in other dialects. There is_ however_ substantial variation across dialects in the production of this sound_ with many dialects and individuals producing some kind of tap or fricated tap (Ó Dochartaigh 1997). We have represented the current two-way contrast as a distinction between /ɾ/ and /ɾʲ/ but it should be noted that there is substantial variation in the production of these sounds. , In word-initial position_ the palatalised variant is almost non-existent so the contrast is effectively neutralised. The preposition ri ‘to’ /ɾʲi/ is reported to use the palatalised variant_ but our speaker did not produce this rhotic substantially different to the rhotic in_ for example_ ràdh ‘saying’ /ɾaː/. In word-medial position_ there is a two-way contrast e.g. aran ‘bread’ /aɾan/_ aire ‘attention’ /aɾʲə/ (produced as [aðə]). In word-final position there is also a two-way contrast e.g. car ‘somewhat’ /kʰaɾ/_ air ‘on’ /ɛɾʲ/ (produced as [ɛð]). In the dialect presented here_ clusters with rhotics_ dental/alveolar stops_ laterals_ and nasals tend to be produced as retroflex_ and the rhotic as a retroflex approximant_ e.g. thuirt ‘said’ [hʉɽʈ]. In -rs clusters_ the rhotic and sibilant are often produced as retroflex_ e.g. carson ‘why’ [kʰaɽʂɔn]. In the vast majority of other Gaelic dialects_ an audible [ʃ] or [ʂ] occurs in -rt clusters_ e.g. thuirt ‘said’ [hʉɽʂʈ]; in some dialects this also occurs in -rd (Watson 1990).

This fact is strongly connected to the situation of language transmission_ which seems to be highly compromised_ because Cagliari Sardinian speakers have stopped speaking their native language with their children and Italian has become the main spoken lan- guage.,Intervocalic singleton /r/ is always realized as [ɾ]_ e.g. pira [ˈ piɾaˈˈ] ‘pear’. In all other con- texts it is realized as a trill [r]_ e.g. traballai [trabːalˈˈ lai] ‘to work’_ rispetu [risˈ petːu] ‘respect’. Therefore_ the alveolar tap [ɾ] is an allophone of /r/ (in word-medial intervocalic position) in all Campidanese varieties and in the Cagliari dialect it is also a sociophonetic variant of /t/ and /d/_ as mentioned before. Consequently_ a word like maridu [maˈ ɾiðu] ‘husband’ in the Cagliari dialect can be realized also as [maˈ ɾiɾu]_ with the first [ɾ] representing /r/ and the second_ /d/. \\ While in other Campidanese varieties /t/ and /d/ are produced as [ð]_ in intervocalic environments_ across word boundaries and within words respectively_ in the Cagliari dialect in these contexts_ they are more commonly realized as an alveolar tap [ɾ]. This sound represents a sociophonetic variant of both /t/ and /d/_ e.g. meda ‘much’ in Cagliari can be realized as [ˈ mɛda] or as [ˈ mɛɾa]; similarly_ su topi ‘the mouse’ can be pronounced as [suˈ ðɔpi] or [suˈ ɾɔpi]. The alternation of these two variants_ [ð] and [ɾ]_ depends on factors such as social class and communicative style. The stigmatized variant is the alveolar tap [ɾ]_ while the fricative variant [ð] is perceived as the standard variant.

Synchronically_ the reviewer’s main idea is (i) to reanalyze /d̺/ as a rhotic at the phonological level_ (ii) to reinterpret /ɸʷ/ as a bilabial approximant_ and (iii) to treat /ʃ/ not as a phonemic unit but as the result of a post-lexical phenomenon of palatalization affecting /s/. Diachronically_ the reviewer also suggests that the origin of /dʒ/ might have been a former palatal approximant */j/. These changes will yield a more symmetric consonantal inventory: /t k b d m n s *j w l r/. The reviewer also made a similar proposal to reinterpret the unrounded high back vowel /ɯ/ as being /u/ phonologically. They are certainly ideas worth considering but_ in order to support them_ it would be necessary to find phonetic_ phonological and historical evidence that we have not found in our data. An alternative would be to develop a more abstract phonological analysis that could accommodate the reviewer’s proposals. However_ this will have to be left for future research since it is outside the scope of this article. \\ If we analyse the [d] apical as a rhotic… Then I’m lost. But it could mean that plosives can emerge from tap. Not really stupid to say there is an allophonic connexion between tap and alveolar voiced plosive (interresting what the author says page 10 about the not possibility of the [d] to be in fact a tap or a trill.,Both the voiced apical-dental plosive /d̪/ and the voiced apical-alveolar plosive /d̺/ are usually realized with a voiced closure phase that lasts between 60 ms and 100 ms followed by a burst word-initially and intervocalically. This type of duration is evidence that /d̪/ is neither a tap nor a flap consonant. A closure phase that long cannot be maintained during the articulation of a tap or flap. \\ The apical-alveolar /d̺/ has an approximant allophone_ [ɹ̺]. Its distribution is restricted to intervocalic environments. It never occurs in syllables associated with a high pitch_ and it freely alternates with [d̺] in syllables that do not have a high pitch.

In the present study_ the speaker also produced the [ɹ] approximant. This tendency may be due to the influence of English_ specifically the Malaysian variety of English_ which uses the post-alveolar approximant. The tap was observed in syllable-initial consonant clusters_ such as in binagri [bi.ˈˈ na.gɾi] ‘vinegarˈ' and pédra [ˈ pɛ.dɾə] ‘stone'.

Among Sinologists_ this approximant onset is commonly described as the voiced fricative /ʑ/ given its weak frication (e.g. Ding 2017). We opted to treat it as an approximant given two observations. First_ there is no other voiced frica- tive in the language. Second_ despite the weak frication_ the percept of this sound for us is closer to a sonorant than a strident fricative. Further studies are certainly needed to ver- ify the observation and to understand the articulatory and acoustic features of this sound fully. , /ɻ/ is a retroflex approximant and differs from /ɹ/ not only in terms of its place of articulation but also in its distinct lip position_ which can be both protrusion and compression depending on its syllabic role_ giving rise to the percept of different types of rounding. The supplementary video recordings illustrate the articulation of these two sounds in /ɹɛn/ ‘personˈ  and /ɻɛn/ ‘cloudˈ (Video01) note that the adoption of the retroflex symbol /ɻ/ does not imply that in Zhushan Mandarin_ its articulation involves extreme displacement and curl- ing of the tongue tip as is typical for retroflex sounds spoken in South Asia (Ladefoged & Maddieson 1996; namboodiripad & Garellek 2017 for Malayalam). Rather_ the retroflec- tion is likely due to retracted tongue back and raised tongue blade_ more similar to what has been reported in ultrasonic data for Standard Chinese (Lee-Kim 2014). Future research_ preferrably with ultrasound imaging_ would be necessary to clarify further the articulation of this sound and the extent of its acoustic and articulatory uniformity with the preceding onset. // /ɻ/ can be syllabic in an onsetless syllable (/ɻ/ for both ‘ifˈ and ‘fishˈ) or following a post-alveolar onset (/tʃɻ̩/ for both ‘pigˈ and ‘residenceˈ_ and /ʃɻ̩/ for both ‘bookˈ and ‘humbleˈ). When serving as a syllabic approximant_ /ɻ/ is realized with a rounding feature better characterized as due to lip compression. /ɻ/ also co-occurs with post-alveolar obstruents as complex onsets. It may be realized very briefly_ giving the impression that the complex onsets are merely retroflex sounds with protruded lips. We have_ therefore_ analyzed /ɻ/ as secondary articulation in /tʃʰɻo/ [tʂʰʷo] ‘mistakeˈ_ /tʃɻo/ [tʂʷo] ‘to sitˈ_ /tʃɻan/ [tʂʷan] for both ‘brickˈ and ‘to donateˈ and /ʃɻɐ/ [ʂʷɐ] ‘to brushˈ. The retroflex feature and lip rounding are further illustrated in /tʃɻɐ/ [tʂʷɐ] ‘to catchˈ (in comparison to /tsa/ [tsɐ] ‘residueˈ).  // /ɻ/ can also serve as an onset by itself (e.g. /ɻe/ ‘moonˈ and /ɻɛn/ ‘cloudˈ). As a simplex onset_ /ɻ/ is realized with a rounding feature better characterized as due to lip protrusion. Thus_ we have posited the same retroflex approximant /ɻ/ for two positional variants with different lip rounding features_ given that they are not minimally constrative. This treatment is similar to the way different lip positions for vowels have been discussed in Ladefoged & Maddieson (1996). The rounded onset /ɻ/ sometimes even induces labialization of the following alveolar nasal coda as observed in /ɻan/ [ɻam] ‘roundˈ_ /ɻan/ [ɻam] ‘softˈ_ and /ɻan/ [ɻam] ‘farˈ. note that when our informant was video-recorded while producing five renditions of /ɻan/ ‘roundˈ (Video02) with a self-administered pause in between_ we observed labialization of /n/ as [m] only in the very first and the fourth renditions ([ɻam]). We consider the bilabial [m] to be a free variant of the alveolar nasal coda /n/ due to the spreading of the labial feature from /ɻ/ for ease of articulation. The distribution of the approximants /w ɻ/ and their related diachronic sound changes will be discussed below as another important areal feature of Zhushan Mandarin.

The rhotics /r/ and /ɾ/ are only contrasted in inter vocalic position in EAS_ as /ɾ/ does not appear word-initially and the opposition /ɾ/ vs. /r/ is neutralized in coda position_ even when EAS speakers maintain the coda consonant instead of deleting it_ which can happen in more formal situational contexts. Following Monroy & Hernández-Campoy (2015)_ we transcribe coda tap and trill phonemically as /r/. These two rhotics are also merged in syllable-final position in Castilian Spanish_ even though this vari- ety of Spanish does not reduce coda consonants in the manner found in EAS. In EAS_ as in Castilian Spanish_ coda rhotics present a continuum of realizations from tap to trill which depend on stylistic and dialectical variation (e.g. Blecua Falgueras 2005_ Bradley 2014). The coda rhotic is the only consonant which shows a different pattern of deletion word-finally and word-internally in EAS. Although it can be maintained in emphatic or in more careful speech_ this rhotic is generally deleted word-finally in everyday conversation. ,As is the case when any consonant is deleted_ word-final /r/ deletion triggers lowering of the previous vowel (explained in more detail in the vowel section) and gemination of the following consonant due to complete assimilation of /r/; the latter also occurs across word-boundary. In word-medial codas_ the rhotic is normally fully assimilated to the following consonant only when it precedes /n/ or /l/ (e.g. perla [ˈ pɛlːa] ‘pearlˈ_ tierno [ˈ tjɛnːo] ‘tenderˈ) or in infinitives preceding an enclitic pronoun starting with /m/_ /l/ or /n/_ e.g. comerlo [koˈ mɛlːo] ‘eat it‘;if this happens_ /m/_ /n/ or /l/ are geminated. The rhotic can_ however_ be maintained in word-medial codas involving /l n/ in careful speech.

In fact_ they never occur at the beginning of the word. A final flap is often followed by an epenthetic vowel_ while a final aspirated flap is often realized with the aspiration voiced so that a breathy-voice vowel occurs finally_ as shown in Figures 19 and 20. In neither case is the final vowel perceived as syllabic by the native speaker. \\ Of interest are disyllabic words with syllabic trills_ shown in (12) and Figures 26 and 27. The trills only occur after alveolar plosives.

The voiced trill occurs in the onset_ coda_ and as the second consonant in clusters within syllable onsets. The voiced trill /r/ is variable and may be realized as [ɾ] or [ɹ]. Figure 6 contrasts /r/ and /r̥/ in the words /r̥ä/ ‘strengthˈ and /rin/ ‘to laughˈ. In /r̥̥ä/ the airflow is directed over the vibrating apical articulator for approximately 0.2 seconds before voicing onset. This contrasts with /rin/ in Figure 6_ where voicing occurs with the trill. ,
